# In order to improve the script, we can provide a column name for the summarized result. 
# This will make the code more readable and easier to understand.
# Here is the updated script:

library(dplyr)

data <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"),
  Score = c(85, 92, 78)
)

# Calculating the mean score and naming the column 'Average_Score'
average_score <- data %>%
  summarize(Average_Score = mean(Score))

# Printing the result
average_score
